## Overview

<a href="#">Postman for macOS</a> is built for developers who spend a large part of their day designing, exercising and hardening APIs. Collections group related requests into documented flows, whether they represent public endpoints, partner integrations or internal microservices. Each request can carry examples, descriptions and test scripts so that behaviour stays clear over time. This makes it easier for teams to align on how their services should behave, even as they evolve across versions and environments.

Environment variables, workspaces and <a href="#">pre-request scripts</a> give structure to how teams move between dev, staging and production. Sensitive information can be isolated while still letting tests and monitors reuse consistent templates. With support for automated test runs and scheduled monitors, Postman extends into lightweight observability, catching regressions and unexpected responses before end users notice. This dual role—design surface and guardrail—helps keep API quality high without requiring fully custom tooling from day one.

On macOS, the Postman app integrates naturally with the desktop, keeping collections and histories close by while leaving plenty of room for code editors and terminals. Keyboard shortcuts, quick search and tabbed layouts make it easy to jump between services and debugging sessions. Over time, many teams begin to treat Postman as the canonical place to see, try and discuss their HTTP interfaces, bridging gaps between backend developers, QA engineers and consumers.
